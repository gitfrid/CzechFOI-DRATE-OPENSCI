Data driven empirical landmark analysis Analysis

Hypothesis: The only purely factual, empirical analysis is conditional on survival to vaccination (or to a landmark day). 
Everything else requires counterfactual modeling.

Goal is to measure the empirical, observed survival benefit after vaccination
— That is not the same as the average causal effect from a common baseline (modell based)
— It answers: From the real individual vaccination date, how much longer did vaccinated individuals live compared to their unvaccinated counterfactual starting at that same point.

Data driven empirical landmark analysis

Hypothesis: The only purely factual, empirical analysis is conditional on survival to vaccination (or to a landmark day). 
<br>Everything else requires counterfactual modeling.

Goal is to measure the empirical, observed survival benefit after vaccination
<br>— That is not the same as the average causal effect from a common baseline (modell based)
<br>— It answers: Observed difference in restricted mean survival time between individuals vaccinated by the landmark and those not yet vaccinated, conditional on survival to the landmark

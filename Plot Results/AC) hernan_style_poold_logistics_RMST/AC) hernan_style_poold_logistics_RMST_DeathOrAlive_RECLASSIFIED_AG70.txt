Figure 1. Cumulative difference in restricted mean survival time, ΔRMST(t), between vaccination and no-vaccination strategies over follow-up time. The solid line shows the point estimate from a pooled logistic regression with spline-based time-varying effects; the shaded area denotes the 95% bootstrap confidence band based on cluster resampling of individuals. The horizontal dashed line at zero corresponds to no difference in RMST.
Figure 2. Restricted mean survival time curves, RMST_v(t) and RMST_u(t), for vaccination and no-vaccination strategies. Solid lines denote the point estimates obtained from the pooled logistic model; shaded bands represent 95% bootstrap confidence intervals based on cluster resampling. These curves describe the cumulative expected survival time under each strategy, without directly displaying their difference.
Figure 3. Standardized survival curves for vaccination and no-vaccination strategies, obtained from a pooled logistic regression with spline-based time-varying effects. Solid lines show the estimated marginal survival probabilities under each strategy; shaded areas correspond to 95% bootstrap confidence bands with cluster resampling. These curves are descriptive and complement the causal contrast shown in Figure 1.
